We live in an exciting age. Traditional ways of thinking are constantly challenged and rapidly changing. 

Fresh ideas, new information, and the ease with which information spreads in our information age have changed the world in numerous ways.

Individuals now have free access to information in ways that humans have not until the internet age. A wide range of viewpoints on diverse subjects are freely available at the stroke of a finger. Research, news, and opinion are practically bombarding from every angle.

Even people who in the past would not have been purveyors of information have become sharers of information things on social media in ways that shape how all of us think about the world we live in.

The quantity of information around us can be almost paralyzing. 

But most of us find ways to cope with the information by filtering it and engaging with the parts we deem important. And we are usually the better for having access to it in the first place. Often this results in us changing as people, or at the very least changing how we view the world around us, and interact with it and behave in it.

Not everything is progressing at the same rate, however. Many of our existing institutions are still rooted in old ways of thinking, which is understandable. Institutions are often big, slow, and not exactly known for agility.

Institutions are significantly different than people in that they are made up of many people, and lots of dynamics at play in how the institutions as a whole relate to and respond to new information.

Take our educational institutions, for example. 

Broadly speaking, our educational institutions are based on a centuries old way of thinking about intelligence: [that it is singular in nature]().

For centuries, the traditional way of thinking of intelligence was that you were either intelligent, or not. It was binary. Or at best, you had a couple different types of smarts: math & science smarts, people smarts, and maybe art smarts (although creative aptitude was not often seen as a type of intelligence).

And it was typically thought that if you had any of the accepted types of intelligence, you had one type, but not the others. That still pervades much of common thinking as evidenced by stereotypes like athletes, creatives, or musicians not being good at math or science however gifted they are at their primary functional gifting.

But thirty some years ago Howard Gardner proposed a theory of nine types of intelligence in his book called [Frames of Mind: the Theory of Multiple Intelligences](https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465024335). The impact of Gardner's work has certainly penetrated our collective consciousness. Most people are at least familiar with the idea of alternative intelligence like emotional intelligence, mechanical intelligence, etc. 

But the extent to which Gardner's thinking has fully penetrated our institutions is shallow at best.

The reality about our educational institutions is that while new content may be taught that reflects these new ideas and ways if thinking, the institutional systems themselves remain largely unchanged from the era of thinking in which the institutions were conceived, defined, and shaped.

Take, for example, our modern schooling system. 

In the United States, we still operate on a model that was developed in the Agricultural age, and optimized for the conditions of a society that was dominated by farming and agriculture (hence the whole notion of having summers off, so children could participate in the work of the family farm).

Many schools have taken their best shot at updating foundational premises to leverage the latest understandings about education and the nature of intelligence. 

But unfortunately, they tend to be the exception, and are often associated primarily with higher income demographics, while the educational institutions serving our most in need members of society are often stuck in outdated and ineffective models of education, from curriculum to course structure to teacher incentivization.

What's exciting though, is how much opportunity there is to be part of helping our institutions catch up to the best ideas and ways of thinking that are emerging constantly.

If we are to move forward as a society or just even as humanity, we will need to update our institutions and their premises. Otherwise, the cognitive dissonance could destroy the institutions that actually have the capacity to do so much good for us when they are properly aligned with where we are at as a society. 

Capitalism and the de-regulation of industry will put out of business the institutions that are failing, and the new successful institutions will be private and less accessible to those who might benefit from them most. 

*(It should go without saying that I'm not just speaking of education, but many institutions of society; education was my example above perhaps because I care about and value deeply what that industry has to offer, but the conversation is more broadly pointed at institutions in general.)*

It certainly seems like a monumental task to help entire industries and institutions change. And it is. Let's not downplay that reality.

But it is also a very exciting thing to consider when we realize the scope of change that lies ahead.

Government, education, business industries, justice systems, media, finance, legal, religious institutions, arts, science and other broad categories which contain myriads of verticals within them are all poised to see disruptors appear, reform eventually adopted, and their impact on humanity improved.

As a product person, I get excited to imagine all the ways that software can play a role in these institutional changes. We see disruptors in the software industry appear like perennial flowers in a spring garden, but software is driving a type of industry disruption that is no longer limited to the software industry itself. 

We've seen it with Uber in the automotive industry, AirBnB in the hospitality industry, Netflix in the entertainment industry, Apple in the music industry, and Amazon in the retail industry. The list goes on and on.

But not just as a product person seeing the potential for making cool things – even just as a human who cares about my community, my family, and the people around us – it's exciting to think about other ways to get involved in these changes that my default perspective doesn't even consider like getting involved in local efforts or lending my voice to larger conversations. Things that are just as important as the technology, products, and businesses driving these societal changes.

The future we desire is coming, whether we get involved or not. But (as always, really) we stand at a point where we can be a catalyst in bring that future to reality, or dead weight which it must overcome to manifest.

Personally, I'd love to be a catalyst.
