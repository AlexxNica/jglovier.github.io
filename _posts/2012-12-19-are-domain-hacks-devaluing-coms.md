title: Are Domain Hacks Devaluing .COMs?
categories: business

<p class="disclaimer">Note: this is purely speculation based on my limited experience, and it is only my opinion. Just sayin'.</p>

<p>Long gone are the days of the "Dot Com" boom, and even the second "Dot Com" boom. And yet, premium dot com domain names still go for tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>However, if you've been to any relatively new startup site or service in the past couple years, you've surely noticed at least a couple sites that don't sport a dot com domain, instead they use a domain hack for their web handle.</p>

<p>A domain hack is when you use something like "somedoma.in" instead of the traditional "somedomain.com" or "somedomain.net", etc. In simple terms, instead of using a standard Top Level Domain (TLD) like ".com", a site uses a country code code domain, like ".es" (Spain's country code) as the URL suffix, substituting part of the actual domain name with the country code. So instead having to register "trees.com", the site owner can register "tre.es", which is significantly shorter. I recently did this with <a href="http://devte.es" target="_blank">devte.es</a>. </p>

<p>There are several reasons to do this. Some people may point to the benefits of having a shorter URL with a domain hack. In fact, URL shortening services like <a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> and <a href="http://getcloudapp.com/" target="_target">cl.ly</a> were some of the first sites to use domain hacks.</p>

<p>Some people might even say that domain hacks just make your product/service look a little cooler.</p>

<p>But in my experience the most common reason for a domain hack is simply because the ".com" version of your domain is taken. </p>

<p>So that begs the question...are domain hacks devaluing ".com" domains?</p>

<p>Personally, I think "devaluing" is too strong a word. The dot com versions of premium domains are always going to have a certain value - even if just perceived, because in marketing perception is everything - that the domain hacks and workarounds simply do not have on their own.</p>

<p>But reducing the market for those domains? Almost certainly.</p>

<p>In fact, just this evening - the very thing that prompted me to write this post - was a friend who shared with me about an interesting business idea that we could work on. I promptly looked up the dot com version, only to find out the asking price is a mere $32,000. Yes, that is THIRTY TWO THOUSAND. For the domain, it may be a reasonable price. But reasonable or not, I don't have that kind of money to spend on it.</p>

<p>So what did I do? I registered the ".co" and ".me" versions instead for two years for about $80 total. Not bad compared against $32K.</p>

<p>And I'm betting I'm not the only one. I think the days when if you wanted to be taken seriously on the web you had to have a .com domain name are fading into the sunset. Granted, you still may have a harder time getting taken seriously with a .biz domain, but with domain hacks pretty readily available, you're options are much broader now.</p>

<p>Sorry Mr. $32K Domain Salesman. I'm sticking with my hack.</p>
