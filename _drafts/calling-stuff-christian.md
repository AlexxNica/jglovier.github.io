Recently I was on Twitter when somebody tweeted something about “top 10 Christian cartoons.” My first reaction was to ignore it completely. Then I was like, “Why do instinctively ignore stuff when it’s labeled ‘Christian’?”

Well I believe there is a very good answer, and it’s not, “because I am ashamed of my own faith,” because I am NOT ashamed of Jesus, the Gospel or my own faith.

The reason I instinctively ignore just about anything that slaps the word “Christian” before it is because so much of the time that adjective is completely misused on the noun to which it is being ascribed.

The truth is that there is only a very select group of things that can appropriately be labeled “Christian”, and it does not include the following cliche religious objects:

1. “Christian” Clothing. This includes t-shirts, entire clothing lines, accessories like a “Jesus First” pin, etc.
2. “Christian” Music.
3. “Christian” Movies
4. “Christian” Concerts or Festivals (see no. 2)
5. “Christian” Cruises. Really???
6. “Christian” books (including comics or cartoons)
7. “Christian” food. One word: Testamints.
8. “Christian” companies.

## So what DOES warrant the use of the term “Christian” as an adjective?

First of all, let’s be clear here that the word “Christian” was originally used as a noun to slander a group of people who simply called themselves followers/disciples of Jesus - or more literally to the Biblical account, followers of the “the Way.” So at the origins of the term were as used to refer to a group of people. PEOPLE. Not stuff.

In adjective form, which I believe is certainly a legit use, the word “Christian” literally means “Christ-like,” or “little Christ.” People who did not follow Jesus actually used the term about early disciples of Jesus to mock them. But still, we see that it has a direct correlation to the aspect of being a person, and your relationship as a person to Jesus Christ (as a follower or an imitator of).

This is why I take such issue with the term “Christian” being thrown around so loosely to refer to things like clothing, music, or books.

I get what is happening here from a cultural perspective. The people who hold to values that are consistent with a Biblical model (note my refusal to say "Christian values") are seeking a simple way to identify things that match up with that same model. I totally get that, and I think it's a natural tendency for people to have. We naturally look for things we identify with, and ways to communicate that we identify with things.

And I think it's a HUGE mistake, and a diservice to the actual message of Jesus.

When we bastardize the word "Christian" by applying it to a bunch of stuff, we are telling people this is what following Jesus is all about. And while there may be a shallow thread of connection between following Jesus and the crap that often gets ascribed as "Christian", we are polutting the message of Jesus when we connect the idea of placing faith in him to our attitude about material things that we think are somehow consistent with that faith.

And half the time when somebody uses the term “Christian” to refer to any one of the items in the above list it is far less noble than I'm trying to give credit for. Often it's actually just a sleezy way to market your product/service/item/event/xyz to an audience of people you want to engage with. I see this all the time. People want to sell something to Christians, so they say, “I’m starting a Christian clothing company.” The motives might be legit (or not) but what they are really doing is just saying, “I want to sell clothes, and Christians are my target audience.”

So whether the motives are pure, or more nefarious, using the term "Christian" to refer to anything other than people who are Jesus followers does a disservice to everybody. Let's just stop it.
