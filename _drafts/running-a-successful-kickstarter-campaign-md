# How To Run A Successful Kickstarter Campaign

(Kickstarter)[http://www.kickstarter.com/] is all the rage these days, and everyone wants a piece of the pie. Even your Grandma has a Kickstarter. She does, doesn't she?

But while setting up and launching your project on Kickstarter is easy-peasy, no one is promising your project will reach it's funding goals - which in Kickstarter land means you get no money at all.

Some people say just use (IndieGoGo)[http://www.indiegogo.com/] or (one of the other Kickstarter alternatives)[http://mashable.com/2012/12/06/kickstarter-alternatives/] where you keep whatever you raise, regardless of whether you reached your goal. For several reasons, I think Kickstarter is still the funding platform of choice, not the least of which is it's audience size which as of this writing has grown to over 3 million people.

Regardless of what funding platform you choose, there are several things you can do to help your chances of reaching your full funding. In my experience running two successful Kickstarter campaigns in the last year, I've learned a few things that I would call clutch for making the most of your project. Here they are in semi-order of importance:

*NOTE: while most of these tips apply across the board, some of them are unique to certain campaigns, like mine. Take what works, ditch what doesn't apply.*

1. Have a compelling video for your project.

2. Ask people in your Twittersphere to promote your campaign.

3. Use plenty of images in your project description.

4. Provide plenty of reward levels. People love to shop with options.

5. Keep your backers engaged. Don't be annoying, but post plenty of updates.

6. Add project FAQs. Everytime someone PMs you a question, respond to it, and then immediately post it to your FAQs section, along with any other related questions is makes you think of.

7. Explain what you are going to do with the money. Be honest, transparent, and explain what you will do if you can raise more than your goal.

8. When possible, offer tangible rewards. Even if your project is not for something your backers tangibly get, come up with= some tangible reward you can give them. It helps create a sense of sentimentality with your audience.

9. Have stretch goals.

10. Properly account for the cost of your project (aka, Kickstarter fees, Amazon fees, etc). Let your audience know that you won't get all of the money raised, so they can properly understand what the project costs you. etc.

11. Have a compelling idea. Come up with a project that people will want to back. Sounds obvious, but it's really one of the most critical parts. Appeal to people's desire to help, desire to have, or desire to be a part of something, and they'll give you their money every time. It might even sound sleazy, but it's just the way we spend our money as humans. You may think your project is awesome, but check around and see if others you talk to about your idea get excited too. If not, you may want to reconsider whether people who don't even know you are going to want to back it.

12. Don't violate the Kickstarter (or other funding platform) rules. One of the quickest ways to ensure your project won't succeed is to violate the funding platform terms.
