title: My Tattoo - Grace & Truth
---

So a couple years ago I got my forearms tattooed with "GRACE" and "TRUTH". Every so often someone asks me about the tattoos, which I typically just reply that they come from a verse in the Gospel of John that says, "For the law came through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Chirst." (John 1:17) That answer is usually enough to satisfy most people's curiosity, so I seldom go further into the reasons why I wear chose to wear my faith of my sleeve this way. But there is much more to the story. I'd like to share the full reason I have these tattoos, partly for my own sake in articulating and recording why I got these tattoos, and partly for any else who may be curious as to the meaning.

## Tattoos are permanent. Duh.

I should note these were not my first tattoos (nor will they be my last). My first tattoo was a very large cross in the middle of my back with the words "LOVE ONE ANOTHER" written on the crossbeam. I've always felt that if I'm going to get something permanently written on my body, it ought to reflect some aspect of myself or my life which I feel is equally permanent. Hence why all of my existing tattoos have a faith theme.

My faith in Jesus is a permanent part of my life. It's a permanent commitment I have made, and adorning my body with a permanent external mark of my permanent internal love for God is a very fitting and beautiful way to display that truth about my life.
