title: Why I'm Selling Dev Tees
---

This year I [launched a Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jag/dev-tees) for a line of t-shirts aimed at programmers. I raised $32,208 from 469 customers and created [Dev Tees](http://www.devte.es/).

I have been designing t-shirts for several years. I've produced both my own shirts before, and shirts for previous employers. Because of my own love of t-shirts, designing them has always been something I really enjoy. The desire to start Dev Tees was born partly out of that joy, partly out of a desire for some extra cash and partly out of a need for a creative outlet. It's been a smashing success.

## Except...

But something else really awesome happend to me this year: [I became a GitHubber](https://github.com/blog/1522-joel-glovier-is-a-githubber). Turns out GitHub pays me well and provides me plenty of creative outlets, so I no longer need Dev Tees to fulfill those needs.

And since my schedule at GitHub has no hourly requirements or boundaries, keeping Dev Tees an "off hours" thing is harder and harder to do. I'd much rather be spending my "off hours" with my growing family than trying to run a business, something which it turns out to not be one of my strong strengths.

While I'm pretty good at coming up with ideas for businesses, it turns out I'm not so great at running businesses. And while I really enjoy designing t-shirts, I don't nearly as much enjoy running a t-shirt business. Especially as a side project.

## Simplifying my life

Most importantly, I want to simplify my life. Since I first started in the design industry almost 10 years ago, I've always had side projects and entrepreneurial persuits. I started as a freelancer because I couldn't find a job. Then 3 years later when I still couldn't find a full-time role I started my own business. Then a few years later when I finally landed a job (albeit a low paying one) I kept plenty of contract work and started side projects for extra cash. Then when I got a better paying job I started more side projects for a creative outlet and kept freelancing.

But I'm finally at a place in my career where I'm paid well enough and I have more than enough creative and technical avenues in my job that I don't *need* to do side projects or freelance work anymore, and now I want to simply enjoy that.

I want to enjoy my 2 year old and 3 year old in the evenings during the week instead of having to work on side projects. I want to be able to stop thinking about the t-shirt business and focus more of my energy and attention on making awesome products at GitHub. I want to stop being involved in things that are not completely focused on where my strengths and talents lie, and focus on the things that are. And at this point in my life the biggest step in that direction is selling Dev Tees to someone who can do even more with it than I can.

## Setting Dev Tees free to grow

But selling Dev Tees is not just about making more room in my life. It's also very much about realizing that I don't have the time and resources to invest into making it grow to what it could become.

There are over 450 people who personally contributed to making Dev Tees a reality through the Kickstarter project. Shutting Dev Tees down would be selling them short. And there's hundreds more people who have shown support for Dev Tees in the few weeks since the Kickstarter.

Dev Tees has been a smashing success in my mind, but there is tons of room for growth. I've built it to where it currently is with incredibly limited time, attention and resources. With a proper advertising budget and strategy, a roadmap for new products, and someone with dedicated creative attention Dev Tees could easily grow to many times what it is now.

## Staying involved (potentially)

Although my intent is to simplify my life and be free of the resopnsibilites of running a t-shirt business (interestingly somethign that [others have also lamented](http://blog.unitedpixelworkers.com/2013/02/20/so-you-want-to-make-a-whole-bunch-of-t-shirts)), I do still enjoy designing t-shirts. I am open to staying involved with Dev Tees if the new owner is interested in having me continue to design apparel. That remains to be seen, but is certainly an option I'm open to.

## Expressing thanks

I specifically want to say thank you to everyone who has helped make Dev Tees a reality. While I've put hundreds of hours of my own time into the project, it would be a complete failure without all of the Kickstarter backers who made it a reality and customers who have supported it since. Thank you for allowing me to build something I'm proud of and that lots of people are really enjoying.

## Spread the word, por favor

Some interest has already been expressed thanks to the [retweets on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jglovier/status/381905414084108288) yesterday, but nothing firm has happened yet so I'm still looking for a buyer. If you know someone who may be interested in taking Dev Tees to the next level, [please put me in touch with them](mailto:info@devte.es?subject=interest%20in%20buying%20Dev%20Tees).
