title: A Time To Work And A Time To Play
---

In America, we have a saying that goes something like, "Trust God, but work hard." It's the epitome of the American dream: the idea that with a combination of hard work and providence we can achieve whatever we set our minds (and our hands) to do.

Like many of us, I grew up with parents who believed in a hard work ethic. They put everything they had into their work. My mom was a kindergarten teacher, and my dad was a chemist. But to them, their jobs were far more than just a paycheck - they were a calling. And over the years I watched as they spent themselves fully on their work.

## All Work And No Play

As much as I admire and respect my parents for their work ethic, still they weren't perfect people. Sometimes that dedication to work seemed to go too far. There were times when I wished my parents simply didn't work so much, both selfishly and out of concern.

Ironically, now as an adult I've found myself in that familiar scenario. I love what I do, and my work is more than just a job to me. It's a calling. I have a passion for honing my skills and putting my talents to work to affect good in the world.

But too often I find myself working more than is healthy. I certainly believe in working hard and being diligent, yet I struggle to strike a balance between a healthy level of hard work, and being consumed with my work.

## A Balance There Must Be

"Why can't I just work all the time?"

I'd never actually say that, but my behavior pattern reflects that question living in my sub-conscience. Maybe I think that if I could simply work more, I'd be more successful. Or that work is really the most important part of life.

Diligence is certainly a critical component to success, but, so is efficiency. Diligence without efficiency leads to mechanical failure.

We humans really are complex, living machines. From intellectual capacity, to cellular structure - any biologist will testify that the human body is one of the most brilliant feats of engineering on planet earth.

But, we are engineered for more than just work. And even machines built solely for work have their limits. As holistic beings, when we lack balance, we tend to suck in those areas, not excel.

Research has shown that people who work less can actually be more productive, so balance is a critical part of productivity.

## Play Time

In many non-western cultures, leisure and recreation are regarded quite differently than in America. Don't get me wrong - when we play, we play hard. But that is exactly my point. We often treat fun and recreation as just another thing to accomplish, to perfect, and to excel at. We treat it like work.

Recently, a good friend reminded me that, "sometimes the journey is just as important as the destination." I started to think, what if I really took that advice to heart?

The time I spend with my family, for example, should not be time that I treat as an obligation I must perform because I know I should, as though I'm just checking off one more item on my task list. It should be savored as a journey which is just as important as its destination.

## The Dead Sea

Growing up I remember hearing an illustration that stuck with me. The illustration described a body of water that has a source, but no outlet. According to this analogy, such a body of water cannot sustain life. However, a pond with both a source and an outlet can have a flourishing ecosystem.

The point of the illustration is that we must not be only receivers, but we must also be givers.

The reverse is also true. The idea that we can constantly output without a sufficient source of input is just as crazy as thinking we can go through life taking and never giving back.

Not just as professionals, and not just personally, but we as *people* need both input and output in balanced measure. Too much input, and we are not productive. But too much output, and we risk burnout.

My suspicion is that for many of us, not enough output is not our problem. Many of us have found great motivation to achieve our goals, and what we are really at risk of is drying up entirely before we ever realize our goals because we spent too much of ourselves without establishing a source from which our output flows.

## Easier Said Than Done

Such a simple problem with such a simple answer and yet so complex.

The question is, "*what things in my life fill me up proportionately to how I am spent on the things which take a toll on me?*" Or in other words, "*What refuels me?*"

Answering such a question requires: 1) an acknowledgement of how much I spend myself daily, 2) an understanding of what measure I am spent, and 3) an understanding of what fills me up.

But a more simple way to look at it is to ask, "*What do I enjoy doing or like to think about when I'm not consumed with work?*"

For me it is quality time with my wife and kids, it is meditating on the Scriptures, it is playing SNES, and a handful of other things. For other people it might be coffee and a good book, rock climbing with friends, working on an engine, or crafting something with your hands.

Sometimes the lines blur a little. And that is okay. What refreshes you from your daily grind may look like work to someone else. But what's important is that you are stimulating a different part of your mind and using creative energy.

## What And Who

None of us wants to turn our backs on hard work, because for most of us hard work is what made us who we are today. Well, that and a lot of providence.

But here's hoping that as we work hard, we too take time to stop, rest, drink in the moment, and remember that the journey is just as important as the destination. Because who we are, the memories we make, the relationships we build in life - these are all just as important as what we do professionally. Maybe more so.
