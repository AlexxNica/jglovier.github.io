As a designer, I often talk to developers who say they feel bad about their design skills, or lack thereof, rather. In fact, a recent Redditor [posted as much](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2l2e8a/overcoming_being_bad_at_web_design/) seeking advice about how he could overcome his subpar command of the design discipline.

## Developer != Designer

The first point to make clear is that just because you are a good developer doesn't mean whatsoever that you should also be a good designer. The two are, in fact, completely different skill sets - at least for the purpose of comparing whether designers and developers should be good at both disciplines.

It is certainly helpful to be at least comptent in both areas, but very rare is the person who can both excell to a very meaningful degree at both developmet and at design (by "excell to a meaningful degree", lets just say I mean you could successfully build a career out of either).

That being said, if you really *want* to improve at design, there are a number of things that you can do to learn and grow in that skill set, just like you might with any other skill set. Cultivating a level of *comptetence* in parralell fields is certainly a noble, if not extreemly valuable, persuit.

## Some basic advice

In reflecting on how I've personally developed as a designer over the years, and what things have contributed the most to my growth as a designer, I can identify a handful of really basic things that could be helpful for anyone who wants to cultivate their own design skill level.

## Learn what even is good design.

Learn the basics of good design principles, look for them in action, and study them (a great resource for programmers is [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/)). Find examples of great design and study what makes it great (just start by studying stuff that stands out to you, or visit sites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or even [CSS galleries](http://unmatchedstyle.com/)).

## Practice. Practice. Practice.

The order of this step is important, however. If you only know how to design poorly, your practice will generally only produce more poor design (unless you really are a natural designer). 

You need to first start by building a mental framework for what constitutes good design, as described above. This includes studying and finding inspiration. Then, your practice should aim toward that visual standard you've cultivated mentally.

##  Seek out critique.

Ask people who are good designers to helpfully criticize your work, pointing how how/where it can improve. Feedback from others is a really important part of the design process. 

Note: everyone takes feedback/criticism differently. For some who put more of themselves into their work and find it hard to deal with criticism, it can be helpful to complete an entire iteration of your work and them seek feedback on the whole, rather than cumulatively along the way (when it's easier to dismiss aspects of criticism because of a false sense about how much more you can/will improve the work).

## Cultivate a style

Design is a tool, and once you realize that you can start to understand what you need your tool to accomplish. If you are a generalist and you work on lots of different types of projects, like a mechanic who needs many tools nearby you may need many styles of design at your disposal. 

However, if you are a specialist and can get away with focusing your work in a particular genre or category, you can focus on honing a particular style that ends up being your go to tool for solving design problems.

Either way, it really helps to think about and cultivate a style that works well for you, and that you are good at.

## Cultivate your taste

Much of design really is about taste. Design taste, much like food taste, is a combination of preference and sophistication. Some of what strikes people as good is about preference, and some of what strikes people as good is about learning to recognize good patterns and practices regardless of whether they are your own preference.

Your own styles might not be the particular taste of everyone, but people should at least be able to look at your work and say it's in good taste. And as is the running theme, you need to cultivate that taste before you can demonstrate it.
