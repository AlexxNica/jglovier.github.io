<p>Over the past year I&#8217;ve had the enormous privilege to be part of an amazing team of professionals called appendTo. AppendTo provides front-end development services and training to enterprise organizations. I&#8217;ve had the chance to work along side <a href='http://appendto.com/team/'>some of the brightest and most talented developers</a> in the industry at appendTo.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also worked on some amazing projects with high profile clients like: TIME Magazine where I worked on <a href='http://appendto.com/case-study/responsive-design-time-com'>the responsive redesign of TIME.com</a> last year; Zumba Fitness, where I served as appendTo&#8217;s Tech Lead for implementing their redesign of <a href='http://www.zumba.com/'>zumba.com</a>; Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer team who I worked with to develop the UX and UI for a special project for the developer community at large they are sponsoring appendTo to create; and other projects that I&#8217;m not privy to mention here.</p>

<p>I joined appendTo as a Visual Design Engineer in May, 2012 via an industry friend, <a href='https://twitter.com/dougneiner'>Doug Neiner</a>. I joined the team at a time when I needed to move on from the nonprofit world for financial reasons, and was thrilled to find a home at a company that is fully distributed, and working on some really amazing projects.</p>

<p>This is my last week at the company.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m moving onto a new position next week that is a wonderful opportunity, but I have nothing but positive sentiments toward appendTo, and the colleagues I&#8217;ve had the privilege to work with.</p>

<p>The move is quite simply a step forward in the direction of where I&#8217;m most passionate as a professional. During my time at appendTo I&#8217;ve mostly been involved in front-end development of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I love to code, but I love to design user experiences and visual constructs much more. This is a step in that direction.</p>

<p>Also, while appendTo has some cool internal products in the works, my role was entirely in the Professional Services wing of the company, and having been doing client services for the better part of 10 years, I&#8217;ve found that personally I thrive best in a products/internal brand environment. This move is also a step in that direction.</p>

<p><a href='http://appendto.theresumator.com/'>AppendTo is hiring right now</a>, and although I&#8217;m leaving the company, I&#8217;ll be the first to say it&#8217;s an amazing organization to be a part of. Apart from working with exceptionally talented people and working on great projects, appendTo is also a very family friendly atmosphere with a stated value on work/life balance - one of the things that made me appreciate the company so much.</p>

<p>AppendTo is experiencing amazing growth right now, and working on some really exciting things. If you are in the market for a new job, you should totally <a href='http://appendto.theresumator.com/'>check out their openings</a>.</p>
